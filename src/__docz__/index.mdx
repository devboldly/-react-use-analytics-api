**React hook for loading the [Google Analytics Embed API](https://ga-dev-tools.appspot.com/embed-api/).**

#### [üëÅÔ∏è Live Demo](/useDataChart#example)

## Overview

The [`useAnalyticsApi`](/useAnalyticsApi) hook can be used to load and ready the [Google Analytics Embed API](https://ga-dev-tools.appspot.com/embed-api/) in React.

> **What is the Google Analytics Embed API?** It is a JavaScript library that allows you to easily create and embed Google Analytics charts on a third-party website in a matter of minutes.

This library also provides a few helper hooks for common operations via the API:

- [useAuthorize](/useAuthorize) - [Authorize](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/embed/v1/component-reference#auth) the user
- [useViewSelector](/useViewSelector) - Render an Analytics [ViewSelector](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/embed/v1/component-reference#viewselector)
- [useDataChart](/useDataChart) - Render a [DataChart](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/embed/v1/component-reference#datachart)
- [useSignOut](/useSignOut) - Sign the user out

> **Looking for components?** A full React component library that wraps these hooks is now available! Check out [React Analytics Charts](https://react-analytics-charts.netlify.com/).

### Features include:

- **üöÄ Easily load the Google Analytics Embed API**
  - Loading and readying the API is handled for you so you can just focus on the good stuff, like embedding charts.
- **üìà Drop in charts quickly and easily**
  - Embed Google Analytics charts on your site in minutes.
- **üíÅ From auth to charts, it's handled for you**
  - Side-effects are handled for common API operations. Need to handle the auth flow, render a view selector, or render charts? Got ya covered!
- **üßº Minimized `window` dependence**
  - Google loads the API to `window`, but this hook pulls the API into a singleton to limit `window` dependence.
- **ü§ù Hooks stay synchronized**
  - When calling the API hook in multiple places, changes to readiness and auth will propate to all hooks, keeping them in sync.
- **‚ú® Live examples and rich documentation**
  - Develop easier with plenty of live examples, starting points, and rich docs.
- **And more!**

### Installation

```
npm i @devboldly/react-use-analytics-api
```

## Quick Start

To load the Google Analytics Embed API, use the [`useAnalyticsApi`](/useAnalyticsApi) hook:

```jsx
import { useAnalyticsApi } from '@devboldly/react-use-analytics-api';
```

Then in your function component: 

```jsx
const { ready, gapi, authorized, error } = useAnalyticsApi();
```

When `ready` is `true`, the `gapi` object will be set to the loaded and ready-to-use [Google Analytics Embed API](/useAnalyticsApi). The `gapi` object will be `undefined` until it is ready to use.

The `authorized` property will be `true` when the user is authorized, `false` otherwise. 

From here, you can [authorize the user](/useAuthorize), [render a view selector](/useViewSelector), and [render charts](/useDataChart)... or do [anything else you want](/useAnalyticsApi#using-the-api-itself) with the API!

> üèÅ For a live example demonstrating all features of this library including full auth flow, see the [useDataChart example](/useDataChart#example). This is a great starting point for building your own charts dashboard.
