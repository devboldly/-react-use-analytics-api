<h1>useAuthorize</h1>

## Description

The `useAuthorize` hook can be used to authorize the user via the [Google Analytics Embed API](/useAnalyticsApi) in several ways:
- Render an authorize button using a [Client ID](https://react-analytics-charts.netlify.app/google-oauth-client-id)
- Authorize with an [access token](https://ga-dev-tools.appspot.com/embed-api/server-side-authorization/)

The user must be authorized before the API can query for things like chart data.

## Usage

```jsx
import { useAuthorize } from '@devboldly/react-use-analytics-api';
```

The `useAuthorize` hook returns an `authorize` function that calls [`gapi.auth.authorize`](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/embed/v1/component-reference#auth) using the provided [auth options](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/embed/v1/component-reference#auth-options).

### Using A [Client ID](https://react-analytics-charts.netlify.app/google-oauth-client-id)

```jsx
const authorize = useAuthorize(gapi, {
  clientId: '1234567890123-abc123def456ghi789jkl012mno345pq.apps.googleusercontent.com',
  container: 'authorize-container-id',
});
```

Call `authorize` to render an authorize button (when signed out) and sign-in information (when signed in) into the container with that ID. The button can be used to authorize the user.

If the user is already authorized and reloads the page, they will be signed in immediately when calling `authorize`.

The contents of the container are not managed by React, so be sure to leave it empty and not to do anything to trigger a render on that container.

#### Limitations

**Google's API doesn't render the authorize button more than once per page load.** Be sure to take this into consideration. 

A novel approach is used in the [example below](#example) to detect whether the container is empty and prompt the user to refresh the page.

### Using An [Access Token](https://ga-dev-tools.appspot.com/embed-api/server-side-authorization/)

```jsx
const authorize = useAuthorize(gapi, {
  serverAuth: {
    access_token: 'ACCESS_TOKEN_GOES_HERE',
  },
});
```

Call `authorize` to authorize using the access token provided.

## Signature

`useAuthorize( gapi: GoogleAnalyticsEmbedAPI | undefined, options: AuthorizeOptions, onSignIn?: () => void ) => (() => void)`

### Arguments

| Argument | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| gapi | `GoogleAnalyticsEmbedAPI` &#124; `undefined` | The [Google Analytics Embed API](/useAnalyticsApi). When `undefined`, calling `authorize` does nothing. |
| options | [`AuthorizeOptions`](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/embed/v1/component-reference#auth-options) | The [options](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/embed/v1/component-reference#auth-options) for the authorization. |
| onSignIn | `() => void` | Called on a successful sign-in. You can use this to do things like change the view on auth success. |

### Return

The hook returns a function, `authorize`.

```jsx
authorize() => void
```

When `gapi` is not `undefined`, this function calls [`gapi.auth.authorize`](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/embed/v1/component-reference#auth) using the provided [auth options](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/embed/v1/component-reference#auth-options).

## Example

The following example demonstrates use of the `useAuthorize` hook with a [Client ID](https://react-analytics-charts.netlify.app/google-oauth-client-id) to sign a user into Google Analytics.

Due to an [API limitation](#limitations), the authorize button can only be rendered to the page once per page load. This means once the container `div` is destroyed and re-rendered by React, the authorize button will no longer appear. 

To see this happening, use the sidebar to navigate to another page on this site (which doesn't trigger a full page reload), then come back to this one. The API will no longer render the authorize button in the example below.

To take this into consideration, we use a `ref` to check if the authorize container has any contents after `authorize` is called. If it's empty when it shouldn't be, we show a prompt to refresh the page. You can replace this with a button that performs a refresh, if you'd like.

<div style={{ border: 'solid 2px #67788a', padding: '20px' }}>
  <UseAuthorizeExample />
</div>

```jsx
import * as React from 'react';
import { useAnalyticsApi, useAuthorize, useSignOut } from '@devboldly/react-use-analytics-api';

export function UseAuthorizeExample(props) {
  const { ready, gapi, authorized, error } = useAnalyticsApi();
  const authorize = useAuthorize(gapi, {
    clientId,
    container: 'authorize-container-id',
  });
  const signOut = useSignOut(gapi);

  // Workaround for API limitation
  const [authorizeCalled, setAuthorizeCalled] = React.useState(false);
  const authDiv = React.useRef(null);
  const hasAuthElements = authDiv.current && authDiv?.current?.children?.length > 0;

  React.useEffect(() => {
    if (ready && !error && !authorizeCalled) {
      authorize();
      setAuthorizeCalled(true);
    }
  }, [authorize, authorizeCalled, error, ready]);

  return (
    <div>
      {!error &&
        (ready && !!gapi ? (
          <div>
            {authorized && (
              <div>
                ‚òÄÔ∏è Logged into Google Analytics! <button onClick={() => signOut()}>Sign Out</button>
              </div>
            )}
            {!authorized && <div>üîê Not logged into Google Analytics</div>}
            <div id="authorize-container-id" ref={authDiv} />
            {!authorized && authorizeCalled && !hasAuthElements && <div>üîÑ Refresh the page to access analytics.</div>}
          </div>
        ) : (
          <div>‚åõ Loading...</div>
        ))}
      {error && <div>{error.toString()}</div>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Manually Synchronizing Hooks

If you authorize or sign out manually outside of this library (and React), you will want to synchronize any hooks you have instantiated so they're aware of your new authorization status.

To do this, you can access the emitter and singleton used by the hooks in this library:

```jsx
import { apiStateEmitter, apiSingleton } from '@devboldly/react-use-analytics-api';
```

Then, when your auth state changes, you can manually update the hooks via the `authorized` event:

```jsx
apiSingleton.authorized = isAuthorized;
apiStateEmitter.emit('authorized', isAuthorized);
```

This will update the authorized state for all existing hooks as well as any new hooks instantiated thereafter.

You don't need to worry about this if you use the `useAuthorize` and [`useSignOut`](/useSignOut) hooks, since they do this for you automatically.
